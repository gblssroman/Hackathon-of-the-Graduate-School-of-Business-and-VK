## üéØ Task 1
The task for VK Predict, a business unit of the company VK, involves developing a predictive model for a pharmaceutical company. This model should predict patient recovery based on test results, specifically for those treated with a new, expensive medication designed to replace a less effective, cheaper one. The data consists of anonymized patient features correlating to test results, with a training dataset (train.csv) including a target feature indicating whether the illness was cured by the medication (values 0 or 1), and a test dataset (test.csv) for predictions. Solution was evaluated using the F1-score metric.
